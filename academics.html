                Academics
            </h1>

            <p>Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay being the most esteemed engineering institute of India, has seen
                many facets of
                students towards the academics. We also get to know many aspects and attitude of students in general
                towards academics
                at IIT Bombay.</p>
            <p>We surveyed the passing out batch to get a more thorough insights into students mentality towards
                academic environment
                here at the institute.</p>
            <p>Here are the bullet points for the same.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A total of 215 students filled the survey form and presented their views across a wide range of
                    questions ranging from
                    departments to CPI to Attitude towards academics and many more.</li>
                <li>From the total of 215 students, 211 students are graduating this year while the remaining 4
                    students took extensions.</li>
                <li>Constantly recognized as the most decorated institute of the country, 95.2% of students agreed
                    that CPI plays a very
                    important role.</li>
                <li>Upon asking, around 66% students said that they were highly enthusiasts about core of their
                    department, which
                    positively showed that they liked their department.</li>
