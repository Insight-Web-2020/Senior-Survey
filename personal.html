            <p>Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay, being the most esteemed engineering institute of India, has seen
                many facets of students when it comes to academics.</p>
            <p>We surveyed the passing out batch to get a more thorough insight into students mentality towards their
                personal life here at the institute. We get to see many aspects and attitudes of students
                in general towards their personal life at IIT Bombay.</p>
            <p>Here is an overview of the same.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A total of 215 students filled the survey form and presented their views across a wide range of
                    questions ranging from Social Life to Relationships to Sexual Desires and many more.</li>
                <li>21.86% students spend less than 1 hour on social media, while 3.72% students spend whopping
                    more than 6 hours.</li>
                <li>The data shows that extrovertness of students has increased considerably during the stay at IIT
                    Bombay.</li>
